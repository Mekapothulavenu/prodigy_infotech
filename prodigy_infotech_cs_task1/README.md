 Caesar Cipher: Text Encryption and Decryption

This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.



 Features
- Encrypt messages using a shift value.
- Decrypt encrypted messages back to plaintext.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).



 How It Works
1. Each letter in the text is shifted by a specified number of places in the alphabet.
2. Uppercase and lowercase letters are shifted independently.
3. Characters that are not letters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.



 How to Use

 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

 Running the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar_cipher.git
   cd caesar_cipher
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Choose **1** to encrypt a message.
   - Choose **2** to decrypt a message.
   - Choose **3** to exit the program.

Example
Encryption
Input:
```
Message: Hello, World!
Shift: 3
```

Output:
```
Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!
```

 Decryption
Input:
```
Message: Khoor, Zruog!
Shift: 3
```

Output:
```
Decrypted Message: Hello, World!
```
